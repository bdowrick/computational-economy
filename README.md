Computational Economy
=====================

This is an **agent-based computational economics simulator**, which is constituted by **agent types** *household*, *factory*, *trader*, *credit bank*, *central bank* and *state*.
The simulator implements a model akin to the **Arrow-Debreu model**, which adheres to neoclassical microeconomic theory, based on polypoly markets perpetuated by agent market participants.
The micro-economic agent behaviors induce complex oscillation patterns attracted to **macroeconomic equilibria** due to the economic feedback cycles of the system.

Agent types
-----------

* Agent type *Household*: Households offer labour hours and consume goods according to **CES** or **Cobb-Douglas utility** functions. Intertemporal consumption and retirement saving preferences are modeled by **Irving-Fisher** and **Modigliani intertemporal choice models**.
* Agent type *Factory*: Factories produce multiple goods (e. g. iron, coal, ...) according to an input-output-model based on **Cobb-Douglas**, **CES** and **root production functions**. Depending on the configured economic model, factories produce and accumulate capital goods, which induce economic growth and depreciate over time (â†’ **Solow-Swan**).
* Agent type *Credit bank*: Credit banks manage bank accounts, create money by credit, trade currencies, follow minimum reserve requirements of central banks and buy bonds for deposits (**fractional reserve banking**).
* Agent type *Central bank*: Central banks adjust key interest rates based on **price indices**. Key interest rates induce changes in buying behaviour via a **monetary transmission mechanism**.
* Agent type *Trader*: Traders import goods from foreign markets for **arbitrage**.
* Agent type *State*: States emit **bonds**, which are bought by credit banks for customer savings deposits. Thereby, national debt represents **retirement savings** of households.


Other entities / features
-------------------------

* General equilibrium: Macroeconomic equilibria reproducibly emerge from non-stochastic microeconomic decision making of agents (â†’ **Arrow-Debreu**).
* Markets: Sellers offer goods on markets. **Settlement markets** transfer ownership of goods and money, automatically.
* Currencies: National **currency zones**, foreign exchange markets, arbitrage.
* Shares: Joint-stock companies are owned by agents and pay **dividends** to them every period.
* Bonds: **Bonds** are given as security for credit in open market operations between central and credit banks.
* Time system: Agents register their actions as events in a **global time system** (observer pattern). At runtime agents can be instantiated and deconstructed at arbitrary points in time, enabling a **dynamic population**. Execution of events is not bound to a fixed sequential order of economic phases, e. g. for production and consumption.
